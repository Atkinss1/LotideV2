# Lotide Library Clone

Welcome to the Lotide Library Clone! This project is a recreation of the Lotide library, aimed at enhancing my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and unit testing.

### Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to reinforce my JavaScript skills and delve deeper into the concepts of unit testing. By recreating the Lotide library, I aim to gain hands-on experience in implementing various utility functions commonly found in JavaScript libraries.

### Features

- **Reimplementation of Lotide Functions**: This project includes re-implementations of several core functions found in the original Lotide library. These functions cover a wide range of utilities, including array manipulation, string operations, and object handling.
  
- **Unit Testing**: Each function within this library is rigorously tested using unit tests. This ensures that the functions perform as expected and helps maintain code quality and reliability.

### Getting Started

To get started with using the Lotide Library Clone, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone git@github.com:Atkinss1/lotideV2.git`


2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary dependencies using npm:

`npm install`


3. **Explore the Code**: Take a look at the source code to understand how each function is implemented. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your requirements.

4. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute the unit tests to ensure that all functions are working correctly:

`npm test`
